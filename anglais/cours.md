# Their commitment/issues

- against reason and sexism, in art world and in daily life
- representation of female figures in art works
- underrepresentation of women artists in museums/art world + women in politics
- few or no opportunities as artists foor women + people of color -> bigotry / gender and racial discrimination
- unfairness
- corruption
- degree of passivity or acceptance -> complicit

# Tools and tactics used in their struggle

- EXPOSE
- posters : print + stick them in the street, then in art places
- eye-opening statistics, sometimes from questionaires
- humor
- outrageous statements
- shock value, exemple : eye-catching masks
- "art of complaining" + they invite public [to do the same | act likewise]
- name-shaming
- debunk some preconceptions
    -> try to change people's minds
